# Data Lab v1

This is version 1 of my open-source-based home lab for data projects.
It's intended to give me a way to experiment with useful data tools mimic-ing (or even directly used in) real-world environments.

This accompanies a few blog posts which can be found here and serves at the proper documentation for this directory:

## Overview

* Microk8s (lightweight Kubernetes)
* PostgreSQL (database)
* Apache Superset (visualization)
* Minio (file storage)
* Airbyte (ETL)
